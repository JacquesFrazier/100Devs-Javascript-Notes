# Javascript-Notes
Notes to help remember, practice and utilize JavaScript principles.
Additionally I will post more elaborate examples within the folder.
It will have its own file if deemed necessary.

Variable Conventions ->

camelCase :

let numberOfApples = 9;

const numberOfGrapes = 10;

var numberOfOranges = 22;

Strings -> 

-store text
-string is surrouned by quotes

ex:

"Hello World";

'Hi World';

let some = 'Mundo' - 
console.log(`Hola ${some}`)

double quotes vs single quotes
-whatever you use on the outside you can't use on the inside.
ex: 'Hi "John Doe" how are you?' -> won't work and will return error

-escaping can help us get around this problem
ex: "Hi \'Jonh Doe\' how are you? " -> will work


Aritmetic in Javascript ->

1. (+) = Addition
2. (-) = Subtraction
3. (/) = Division
4. (*) = Multiplication
5. (%) = Modules


General Notes:

Comparsion -> === or ==

Assign -> =


Functions -> 

reusble sets of instructions.

ex:

function name(parameters){
//body
}

//call
name(arguments)
